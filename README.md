# AI-Kirana-Store
Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a method of determining the relationship between various products purchased by a consumer. By identifying associations between the different products placed in a shopping basket, this method studies the buying behavior of customers. By gaining insight into what items consumers purchase frequently, retailers can tailor their marketing strategies. This helps the retailer in developing and planning promotional strategies by taking into account the various products purchased together. The focus of this research is on a small Kirana store that sells vegetables, fruits and regular grocery items. The main objective of this project is to help the Kirana Store Vendor to transform their store and make it more organized. By using the Kirana store offerings, a unique combination of Market basket Analysis and Computer Vision model is created. The customer transaction data is used to find out the product association and to help the vendor organize the shop. Vendor can take a picture of shop, detect the items in the picture with trained object detection model and look forward to the associated items from the items available in the picture.
